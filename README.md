## My process

I first completed the HTML structure and then focused on styling with CSS to meet the challenge requirements. I followed a mobile-first approach and gradually refined the layout and design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project, I practiced my basic understanding of HTML and CSS by applying them in a real task. I also learned the importance of a mobile-first workflow.

Additionally, I learned how to:
-Manage files effectively in the VS Code editor
-Create and structure a Markdown (README.md) file
-Understand and follow Figma designs for professional learning and growth

    </p>
  </div>
</main>

```css
.container {
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
.card {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  width: 320px;
  padding: 16px;
  border-radius: 20px;
  text-align: center;
  box-shadow: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
}

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my HTML and CSS skills, especially in building more responsive layouts. I plan to practice Flexbox more and start learning CSS Grid for more complex layouts.

I also aim to:

-Write cleaner and more maintainable code
-Improve accessibility practices
-Gain more confidence in understanding Figma design files
-Strengthen my workflow using Git and GitHub
-Gradually move toward JavaScript to add interactive features
